    <p>Not all classrooms have four walls and travel is the best way to immerse myself in geography, history, culture, gastronomy, languages, biology â€¦ you name it. Travel enriches the mind and educates me far beyond any textbook or travel guide. Not only do i learn about different landscapes, languages and lifestyles; glean fascinating facts while observing wild animals in their natural habitats</p>

    <p>The best part about my travelling eperiences is   the freedom of being able to just wake up and pick a spot anywhere on the map and find a way to get there. Travel enables me to be spontaneous and seek new experiences.</p>
    <p> Travel allows me to escape life's daily demands, dramas and deadlines and enables me to clear my mind. It encourages me to recharge my batteries and to truly disconnect (from my phone, Wi-Fi, emails, laptop, social media, etc.) in order to reconnect (with myself and the natural environment).</ol>
    <p> The most amazing places i have visited in kenya are:</p>
